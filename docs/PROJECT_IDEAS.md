## Tips for Using These Ideas

1. **Start with the SERP API** if you're not sure which product to use — it's the fastest to set up
2. **Combine products** for richer data (e.g., SERP API to find URLs, then Web Unlocker to scrape them)
3. **Add AI** on top of scraped data for extra impact (summarization, classification, recommendations)
4. **Focus on the demo** — judges love live data that updates in real-time
5. **Check the [product guide](PRODUCTS.md)** to pick the right tool for your idea
